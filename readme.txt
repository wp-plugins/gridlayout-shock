== Screenshots ==

1. As you can see you only need to change some values to obtain the desired effect.
2. As you see here there’s no more code than just the shortcode created by the plugin, that simple code let us generate all the pinboard. 
3. Among the options you have to create the pinboard, you can choose the box style to make it fit your theme, you can choose between eight different styles. 
4. The complete post won’t be shown in the pinboard, because of that it’s needed a read more button, we’ve seen that one color most of times is not enough, therefore we have added 7 colors to choose from.  You can also leave aside the button if you don’t want it, instead you’ll have just a link to the full post.
5. As you can see there’s just two post instead of all of the category.
6. You can define the boxes size, however you only define the width of them, because the height is defined by the content of the box, the width change the number of boxes shown in the same row.
7. Font size and Font type.
